# Titanic-Classification
##  Overview
This project is a data science and machine learning task that aims to predict whether passengers aboard the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more. It utilizes the famous Titanic dataset, a classic dataset in the field of data science.

## Project Structure
- Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical data into a suitable format for machine learning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into passenger demographics and survival rates.
- Model Building: A logistic regression model is built and trained using Scikit-Learn to predict passenger survival.
- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy metrics on both training and testing data.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- Required libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).
- The Titanic dataset (CSV file) is available in the specified location.

## Usage
- Load the Titanic dataset.
- Preprocess and clean the data.
- Explore the dataset through visualizations.
- Build and train the logistic regression model.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy on training and testing data.
- Make predictions using the trained model.

# Conclusion
The Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrates the end-to-end process of solving a classic machine-learning problem. By analyzing passenger data, preprocessing it, building a predictive model, and evaluating its performance, we gain valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates aboard the Titanic.
